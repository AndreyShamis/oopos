	This program provide tools for manipulations with virtual memory
	
	For compile just run:
		
		make
		
	for run the program use next comand line
		
		./ex8
		
	The Directory must have file exec.
	And after runing the program file directory get new file called
	swap_file

============================= EX8 ============================================
	Program - manipulator of virtual memory. The program creates a simulation 
of virtual memory in the computer. 
	
	At the end of the program execution, the program prints a report on the use 
of memory and the memory state that it is at the moment, but also prints a 
status page table. 
	
	It should be noted that the program was used by the algorithm pulling 
a block of memory on slightly different criteria, namely the elongated 
block of memory that has been accessed after all.

	Also worth noting that the program should also take into consideration in 
mind that the main it is necessary to run a successful program execution 
spellings us should be placed in the directory that contains the program 
itself is a text file that serves as a principle the program itself which
is supposedly we run. 
	
	It is desirable that this file would contain a 1024-byte because the 
consequences are more or less that file is not predictable. 

	Which in turn is explained by the task, since no one had asked to check 
a file size that is also not mentioned in the specification of all sizes 
should be a file.

	Added:
	
	In this version the file reading from exec use mmap function.

	Data section can be changed and saved to swap.
	
	In our previuos version the information abouta hits and other information
was added, so this part of changes we didn`t have to do.
