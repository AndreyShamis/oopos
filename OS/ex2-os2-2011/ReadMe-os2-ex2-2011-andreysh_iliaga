======================= description of the script =============================

<<<<<<< abstruct description >>>>>>>>>>

the program get c language file that not include documentation at all. the
program read the file and analyze of it contents (function, virebals, const and
more..). the program prisent to the user all the contents of the file
(function, virebals, const and more..) in serial order and ask the user which

A. the program take and analyze the content of the file and save them at array
   of strings data structur.
B. right after the script read all the data - the script will ask the 
   documentation of each of them: (see the next chapter).
C. there is 6 aspekts that need to be documening at the destination program:
   
	1. all the *.h (all the include files) -- can appear at the begin of 
	   the file only.
	2. all the constant can only appear between include files and the main
	3. documentation of the main function.
	4. documentation befor each block of code at main function. (in ather 
	   words btween to adjacent lines - no nessesery to docomenting). this 
	   aspekt refer to the main function documentation only.
	5. any function (what it get, what it return and what it dose). and at 
	   the statement of the function - need only a short documentation 
	   abuot what that function dose.
	6. all the virebals -- that appears at the begin of the function only
	   (this aspect incude all function at the c code, include the main

  INSTALLATION OF PDF CREATOR

    Quick answer:

        perl -MCPAN -e 'install PDF::Create'

    Long answer:

    To install manually, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
    distribution and do one of the following:

    a.  Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using the perl
        program into whose library you want to install and then run
        make three times:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    b.  To install into a private library, for example your home
        directory:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=$HOME/lib INSTALLMAN3DIR=$HOME/man
            make
            make test
            make pure_install
