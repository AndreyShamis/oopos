Colored Balls:
The game has N number of colored balls. Balls appear on the map with a certain probability. That is, if we have a map 4 red 3 blue and 2 green. Then the probability of loss is:  

 P(Red) > P(Blue) > P(Green)
And
 P(Red)>P(Blue)>P(Green)>P(Red/Blue)>P(Blue/Green)>P(MultiColor)

Also pay attention to the fact that the probability of dropping out of a color depends on slozhnosi games as well as the level where you are.
