======================= description of the script =============================

	Program to compare the four types of algorithms run processes in a super 
computer (since the required number of processors exceeds the number that we 
see today in our desktop PCs). 

	Precisely the fact that it was told by and shown on tutoring and program 
up and running. The program receives four types of data: 

	The first is as mentioned above with the incoming data file that 
contains all sorts of necessary and unnecessary information (not needed 
because we do not use).
	Then get the number of virtual processors, well, actually what is 
called memory. It is worth noting immediately that we seem to share the memory 
between processes, as follows, namely, call the choice of a random number 
within a predetermined value, so stupid to ask the program because of the 
value of memory a value equal to zero. 
	And the last is the most important parameter that receives the program 
is a type of algorithm which we will test. As said and shown but the 
extra lessons. 

	At the end of the job all the information printed in the log file name 
is equal to incoming data, the number of processors, memory, and of others. 

	Log file contains any additional information and Owned by the late start 
time and start implementation of a specific process, the waiting time for 
each of them, time just, well, the overall employment rate of the processor 
because of the percentage numbers. 

	Just during the script run every kind of simulation accelerators, 
that is, if there is no process that should start to work or even work, 
as well as at a particular time does not enter a new process, and we know 
exactly when this process should proceed, then we jump to that time . 
And the wisdom of other programming to accelerate the simulation, taking 
into account the fact that we have no influence on the statistics that 
interest us.
